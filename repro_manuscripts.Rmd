## Preliminary Notes

This tutorial is intended to facilitate collaborative work on R analyses and RMarkdown manuscripts. Mittels RMarkdown kÃ¶nnen Manuskripte verfasst werden. Manuscripts can be written using RMarkdown. Results from analyses in R can be automatically integrated into the text. Furthermore, you can include tables or figures created in R directly to your RMarkdown manuscript. This is extremely helpful and provides a great benefit. One drawback, however, is that collaborative work is made more difficult because annotations and comments are difficult to insert.This can be at least partially solved with the help of Git Hub. Since there is a multitude of implementation possibilities, this tutorial does not claim to be exhaustive.
All information listed here have been drawn and prepared from various documentations and tutorials, for example:

First, we will make all the necessary preparations in R and GitHub. Then we will describe how to work collaboratively on scripts and texts.

# Set up Git and RStudio

## GitHub and Git

First, you have to sign up at GitHub (https://github.com/) and download Git (if you have trouble installing Git, I would recommend [this](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) tutorial). 

_Attention! If you use Windows, Git will automatically be installed into you C:/Program Files/ directory. Often, the space in the directory name causes problems. Therefore, I would recommend to choose a differenct directory for installation._


## RStudio

Now that Git is installed, we need to link it to RStudio. Open RStudio and go to \textsc{Tools -> Global Options}. Navigate to \textsc{Git/SVN}, check \textsc{Enable version control interface for RStudio projects} and paste the path to your Git executable in the corresponding field and klick \textsc{OK}.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", fig.align="center", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/scheffel/Scheffel/R/Reproducible-Manuscripts/Integrate_Git.png")
``` 

Now everything is set up and you can start a new collaborative project!
